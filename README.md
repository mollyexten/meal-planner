# Project Overview

## Meal Planner

[Your deployed site] ("url in strings")

## Project Description

The meal planner application enables a user to look up recipes based on the ingredients they have using the TheMealDB API. The search results will include links to the full recipes, with ingredient list and directions.

## API and Data Sample

Here is a link for Honey Teriyaki Salmon ("https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=honey%20teriyaki%20salmon")

## Wireframes

Meal Planner Search ("https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/64297a170417181")
Meal Planner Recipe ("https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/e0d6f63c3417182")
Both wireframes are also included as PDFs in this GitHub repo.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Use Axios to make a request to TheMealDB API and insert information on ingredients, dishes, photos, and directions to the DOM
- Render search results for a specific ingredient on page
- Make functioning links for dishes that pull up a recipe 
- Style using Flexbox
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first design)
- Use a media query/breakpoint for desktop screens

#### PostMVP  

- Add a save recipe button to collect recipes in a recipe box
- Aggregate ingredients from saved recipes into a master grocery list
- Include quantities of ingredients needed on master grocery list

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## Code Snippet

(Coming soon) I am proud of this piece of my code:

```
function codey(mcCoderson) {
	// codey code code
}
```
