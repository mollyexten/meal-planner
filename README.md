[Your deployed site] ("url in strings")

## Project Description

Phrasal Verb Finder enables English language learners to look up a phrasal verb and save phrasal verbs to review later.

## API and Data Sample

Here is a link of the [dictionaryapi for the run] ("https://www.dictionaryapi.com/api/v3/references/learners/json/run?key=90dc8353-ef36-45bf-bf5e-c6d89a598b99")
```        "dros": [
            {
                "drp": "run across",
                "gram": "phrasal verb",
                "def": [
                    {
                        "sseq": [
                            [
                                [

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.
Use wireframe.cc link
[Your Wireframe] (wireframe.cc link)

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Feb 22-23| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Feb 23| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Feb 24| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Feb 24| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Feb 25| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Feb 26| MVP | Incomplete
|March 1| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
