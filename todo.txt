Post-MVP Ideas:
1. Add option to remove saved recipes
2. Add button to clear all saved recipes
2. Improve footer - gray, stays at the bottom, not appended within main but not overlapping with image in desktop view
3. Consider making ingredient parameter optional
4. Add a back-to-recipe button from explore
5. Remove "randomRecipe" and "exploreRecipe" items from local storage if clicked on from a search result
