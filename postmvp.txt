Post-MVP Ideas:
1. Add option to remove saved recipes
2. Add button to clear all saved recipes
3. Improve footer - gray, stays at the bottom, not appended within main but not overlapping with image in desktop view 
    (I think the layout problem has something to do with the way the home image is loading into the flexbox, but I'm not sure)
4. Consider making ingredient parameter optional
5. Add a back-to-recipe button from explore
6. Remove "randomRecipe" and "exploreRecipe" items from local storage if clicked on from a search result
